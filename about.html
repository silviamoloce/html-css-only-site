            Twenty One Pilots (stylized in all lowercase or as twenty øne piløts) is
            an American musical duo from Columbus, Ohio. Initially a band, the group
            was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist Tyler Joseph along with Nick Thomas
            and Chris Salih, who both left in 2011. Since their departure, the
            line-up has consisted of Joseph and drummer Josh Dun. The duo is best
            known for their singles "Stressed Out", "Ride", and "Heathens". The
            group received a Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the
            59th Annual Grammy Awards for "Stressed Out". The band independently
            released two albums, Twenty One Pilots (2009) and Regional at Best
            (2011), before being signed by record label Fueled by Ramen in 2012.
            Their label debut, Vessel, was released in 2013 and became the second
            album in history on which every track received at least a gold
            certification, making Twenty One Pilots the first band in the history of
            music to see every song on two albums earn gold or platinum awards

            The duo achieved breakthrough success with their fourth album,
            Blurryface (2015), which produced the successful singles "Stressed Out"
            and "Ride" and became the first album on which every track received at
            least a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of
            America.[2][3] The release of the single "Heathens" also made the group
            the first alternative artist in history to have two concurrent top five
            singles in the Billboard Hot 100 and the third rock act in history to
            have two singles simultaneously chart in the top five of the Billboard
            Hot 100, joining the Beatles and Elvis Presley.[4] The duo has released six studio albums in total,
             with the latest being Scaled and Icy, released on May 21, 2021. They have also garnered ten No. 1 songs on the 
             Alternative Songs chart, making them the artist with the fourth-most number-one songs on the chart, just below Linkin Park
             .[5]
